    "This project explores what can be learned from an extensive housing dataset that is embedded in a dense social context in Cook County, Illinois.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, in project A.1, we will guide you through some basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the data. Next, you will be adding a few new features to the dataset, while cleaning the data as well in the process.\n",

Since `Roof Material` is a categorical variable, we will have to one-hot-encode the data.  Notice in the example code below that we have to pre-specify the categories. For more information on categorical data in pandas, refer to this [link](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/categorical.html). For more information on why we want to use one-hot-encoding, refer to this [link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/).\n",

    "**Note**: You should avoid using `pd.get_dummies` in your solution as it will remove your original column automactially and is therefore not as reusable as your constructed data preprocessing pipeline. Instead, you can one-hot-encode one column into multiple columns using Scikit-learn's `OneHotEncoder` ([documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html)). It's far more customizable!\n",

You will be well-prepared to build such a model: you have considered what is in this dataset, what it can be used for, and engineered some features that should be useful for prediction. Creating a house-pricing model for Cook County has some challenging social implications to think, though, however. This will be addressed in Lecture 18 and Tuesday discussion.\n",
